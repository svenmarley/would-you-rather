# Would You Rather - Udacity university project

This application allows a user to create a list of dual questions that people can answer.
Ex:  Would you rather `kiss a tiger` or `ride a bear`.

Note:  new questions are not retained between sessions.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a project I created getting my nano-degree from Udacity in their [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
