# Would You Rather - Udacity university project

This application allows a user to create a list of dual questions that people can answer.
Ex:  Would you rather `kiss a tiger` or `ride a bear`.

Note:  New questions are not retained between sessions.

This is a project I created getting my nano-degree from Udacity in their [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Project Setup

* clone th project - [Github would-you-rather](https://github.com/svenmarley/would-you-rather)
* run the server -`npm install` then `npm start`
    * this will install all needed dependencies
    * will start a web server
    * open the app in the default browser
        - Note: it runs on port 3000 today
